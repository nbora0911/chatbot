A repo build a chatbot that answers questions from a or syllabus or any standard information document. The goal is for this bot to assist teaching assistants (often graduate students) by replying to frequent queries from students. 

# Objectives:  

Learning: 
- Fundamentals of deep learning in NLP
- Cover building blocks such as RNNs, LSTMs, and Transformers (deep enough to enable coding them from scratch)
- Understanding and deploying SOTA approaches for Question Answering  
- Understand process of fine-tuning networks on small datasets 

Product: 
- Deploy model into question answering app usable by TAs using Flask
